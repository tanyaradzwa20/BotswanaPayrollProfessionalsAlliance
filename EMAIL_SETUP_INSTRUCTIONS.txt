BPPA Contact Form - PHPMailer Email Setup Instructions
=======================================================

Your contact form is now configured with PHPMailer for reliable email delivery!

FILES INCLUDED:
---------------
1. send-email.php - Handles form submission using PHPMailer
2. PHPMailer/ - Complete PHPMailer library
3. .env - Email configuration file (IMPORTANT: Configure this!)
4. Updated contact.html - Form submits to PHP script
5. Updated main.js - Handles AJAX form submission

SETUP STEPS (REQUIRED):
-----------------------

Step 1: Configure .env File
----------------------------
Open the .env file and update these settings:

SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"          <-- Your Gmail address
SMTP_PASS="your-16-digit-app-password"    <-- Gmail App Password (see below)
SMTP_PORT=587

Step 2: Generate Gmail App Password
------------------------------------
1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click "Security" in the left menu
3. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled
4. Search for "App passwords" in the search bar
5. Click "App passwords"
6. Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
7. Enter "BPPA Website" as the name
8. Click "Generate"
9. Copy the 16-character password (remove spaces)
10. Paste it into SMTP_PASS in your .env file

Step 3: Update Recipient Email (Optional)
------------------------------------------
The form currently sends emails to: info@bppabw.com

To change this:
1. Open send-email.php
2. Find line: $mail->addAddress('info@bppabw.com', 'BPPA');
3. Change to your preferred email address
4. Save the file

Step 4: Upload to Web Server
-----------------------------
Upload these files/folders to your web hosting:
- send-email.php
- PHPMailer/ (entire folder)
- .env
- contact.html
- assets/ (entire folder with updated main.js)

TESTING:
--------
1. Visit your contact page on the live website
2. Fill out the form completely
3. Submit and wait for success message
4. Check the inbox of the recipient email
5. Check spam folder if not received

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------

Error: "SMTP connect() failed"
- Check SMTP_HOST is "smtp.gmail.com"
- Check SMTP_PORT is 587
- Verify your internet connection
- Try port 465 with SSL instead

Error: "Invalid credentials"
- Double-check SMTP_USER is your full Gmail address
- Verify SMTP_PASS is the 16-digit App Password (not your regular password)
- Remove any spaces from the App Password
- Regenerate App Password if needed

Error: "Could not authenticate"
- Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled on your Google Account
- Use App Password, not regular Gmail password
- Check if "Less secure app access" is needed (older accounts)

Emails go to spam:
- Add the sender email to your contacts
- Mark emails as "Not Spam" a few times
- Consider using a custom domain email instead of Gmail

SECURITY NOTES:
---------------
✅ PHPMailer library provides secure SMTP authentication
✅ .env file keeps credentials separate from code
✅ Form validates all inputs before processing
✅ HTML tags stripped from user input
✅ Email addresses validated
✅ AJAX submission for better user experience

IMPORTANT:
----------
⚠️ Never commit .env file to version control (GitHub, etc.)
⚠️ Keep your App Password private
⚠️ Test thoroughly before going live
